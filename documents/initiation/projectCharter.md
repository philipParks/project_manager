# Project Charter

## General Information

**Project Title:** Project Manager Application

**Description:** An application for the management of projects.

**Version:** 1.0

**Date:** 20 March 2025

**Project Manager:** Philip Parks

**Project Sponsor:** Philip Parks

## Vision

### Objectives

- Demonstrate an ability to follow the project management life cycle.
- Demonstrate an ability to follow the software development life cycle.
- Establish a template for future projects.
- Develop a project management application for tracking future projects.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to design, develop, and implement a project management application aimed at helping
organizations effectively manage tasks, resources, timelines, and communications within a single platform. The
application will allow project managers and teams to collaborate efficiently, track progress, manage deadlines, and
ensure successful project delivery. The application aims to reduce inefficiencies, improve transparency, and streamline
project workflows.

### Preliminary Scope

**User Authentication & Authorization:** Role-based access for users (Project Managers, Team Members, Stakeholders) with
secure login/logout, password recovery, and account management.

**Project Creation & Management:** Capability to create and manage multiple projects, including setting project goals,
assigning tasks, and tracking milestones.

**Task Management:** Features to create, assign, prioritize, and track tasks with deadlines, notifications, and
dependencies.

**Time Tracking & Scheduling:** Gantt chart functionality, calendar integration, and time tracking for individual tasks and
overall project timelines.

**Resource Management:** Allocation of resources (human and material) with monitoring for availability and capacity.

**Collaboration Tools:** Real-time chat, file sharing, and comment sections for team discussions on tasks and projects.

**Reporting & Analytics:** Ability to generate progress reports, risk assessments, task status, and other analytics to
provide project insights.

**Notification System:** Alerts and reminders for upcoming deadlines, task updates, and project changes.

**Integration with Third-party Tools:** Ability to integrate with popular tools like Slack, Google Calendar, and other cloud
storage services.

### Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful if the following criteria are met:

The application is fully functional with all core features as defined in the scope.

The system is free from critical bugs and vulnerabilities.

The application meets the performance benchmarks for speed and reliability.

User feedback from beta testing is overwhelmingly positive.

All documentation is complete and delivered as per project requirements.

### Expected Benefits

A project management application that will demonstrate the ability of the project manager to appropriately and
successfully follow the project management life cycle and the software development life cycle to the completion of a
fully functional software application.

### Risks

Developing a project management application comes with several risks that can affect the project's success. Some of the key risks include:

1. **Scope Creep**:
    - This occurs when the project's requirements continuously expand beyond the original plan, leading to delays, increased costs, and misalignment with the initial objectives.
    - It’s crucial to define clear requirements and maintain strict control over changes.

2. **Poor User Experience (UX) Design**:
    - If the application is difficult to use or doesn’t meet the needs of its target users, it may fail to gain adoption. A complex or unintuitive interface can turn users away.
    - Ensuring the design is simple, intuitive, and user-centered is critical.

3. **Integration Issues**:
    - The application may need to integrate with existing tools (like calendar apps, email, or other software). Integration problems could result in functionality gaps, data inconsistencies, or failures.
    - Proper planning and thorough testing of integrations with other systems are necessary.

4. **Data Security and Privacy Concerns**:
    - Project management tools often handle sensitive data, including confidential business plans, client information, and employee data. If security measures aren’t properly implemented, the application may be vulnerable to data breaches or unauthorized access.
    - Following best practices for encryption, data storage, and compliance with privacy regulations (like GDPR) is essential.

5. **Underestimating Development Time and Costs**:
    - Software development can often take longer and cost more than initially planned. If these factors are not adequately managed, it could lead to budget overruns, project delays, or reduced quality.
    - Realistic budgeting, clear timelines, and constant monitoring of project progress are necessary to avoid this.

6. **Lack of Scalability**:
    - If the application is not designed to handle growth in users, features, or data volume, it might struggle to meet future needs, leading to performance issues.
    - It's important to design the app with scalability in mind from the outset to support growth.

7. **Inadequate Testing**:
    - If testing is insufficient, bugs and performance issues may remain undetected, potentially frustrating users or causing application failures.
    - Comprehensive testing throughout development (unit tests, integration tests, user acceptance testing) is critical.

8. **Regulatory Compliance**:
    - Depending on the industry, the application may need to comply with certain regulations (e.g., HIPAA for healthcare, or financial regulations for accounting). Failing to adhere to these rules can lead to legal issues or fines.
    - Ensuring the app meets all relevant legal and regulatory requirements is vital.

9. **Market Competition**:
    - There are many project management tools available, and your application might struggle to differentiate itself in a crowded market.
    - Conducting thorough market research, defining a unique value proposition, and understanding customer pain points are necessary to stand out.

10. **Change Management and Adoption Resistance**:
    - Employees or teams may resist adopting a new tool, especially if they’re used to an old system. Without proper change management strategies, the tool may not be used effectively.
    - Providing training, support, and clear communication about the benefits can help mitigate this risk.

11. **Vendor and Third-Party Dependency**:
    - If the application relies on third-party vendors for services such as cloud hosting, authentication, or API services, any disruption in those services could affect the project.
    - It's important to vet third-party services carefully and have contingency plans in place.

12. **Poor Maintenance and Support**:
    - After the application is launched, it needs continuous updates, bug fixes, and technical support. Lack of attention to post-launch maintenance could lead to users abandoning the tool.
    - A strategy for ongoing maintenance and customer support should be part of the development plan.

Managing these risks involves careful planning, monitoring, and ongoing communication with stakeholders throughout the development process.

### Assumptions and Constraints

**Assumptions:**

The application will be developed using Java.

The target user base will have access to systems capable of running a Java application.

The project will utilize agile methodologies for iterative development and testing.

User feedback will be incorporated during the testing and feedback phases.

The application will comply with relevant data protection and privacy regulations, including GDPR where applicable.

**Constraints:**

Limited budget and timeline for development, meaning some features may be prioritized over others in initial versions.

Availability of key stakeholders for feedback and testing phases.

The application must be scalable but will initially focus on small to mid-sized teams.
