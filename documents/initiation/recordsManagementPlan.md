# Records Management Plan

## Project Management Artifacts

### Budget

There will be a master budget sheet and that will be broken down into departmental budgets.

#### Creation
**Naming Convention:** The budget will have a title that uses the following, "{Project Name} Budget."
Each department budget will use the following, "{Department}, {Project Name} Budget."

**File Owners:** the department budgets will be owned by the respective departments. The master budget sheet will be 
owned by the project manager.

**Classification:** Internal, need-to-know (anyone with an A, or an I on the RAM) only.

**Confidentiality Expectations:** It is expected that discussions about the budget will only take place between those 
with an A, or an I on the RAM.

#### Storage & Retrieval
**Version Control:** The budget will be maintained on a database with strict accessibility rules.

**Retrieval/Sharing:** The budget will need to be shared with anyone with an A, or an I on the RAM. Groups will be made
for the database to allow for the retrieval and sharing of budget documentation.

#### Archival & Disposal
**Duplicate Files:** Physical duplicates will be shredded or burned once they have served their purpose. Electronic
duplicates will be deleted once their purpose has been served.

**Archival:** After the project is complete, the documents will be transferred to the financial department for further
processing.
