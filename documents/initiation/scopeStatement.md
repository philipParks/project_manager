# Scope Statement

**Project Scope Statement:** Development of a Project Management Application

**Project Title:** Project Management Application

**Project Start Date:** TBD

**Projected End Date:** TBD

**Project Manager:** Philip Parks

**Project Sponsor:** Philip Parks

## Project Purpose and Justification

The purpose of this project is to design, develop, and implement a project management application aimed at helping 
organizations effectively manage tasks, resources, timelines, and communications within a single platform. The 
application will allow project managers and teams to collaborate efficiently, track progress, manage deadlines, and 
ensure successful project delivery. The application aims to reduce inefficiencies, improve transparency, and streamline 
project workflows.

## Scope Description

The scope of this project includes the full lifecycle of developing a robust project management application. The 
application will feature the following:

**User Authentication & Authorization:** Role-based access for users (Project Managers, Team Members, Stakeholders) with 
secure login/logout, password recovery, and account management.

**Project Creation & Management:** Capability to create and manage multiple projects, including setting project goals, 
assigning tasks, and tracking milestones.

**Task Management:** Features to create, assign, prioritize, and track tasks with deadlines, notifications, and 
dependencies.

**Time Tracking & Scheduling:** Gantt chart functionality, calendar integration, and time tracking for individual tasks and 
overall project timelines.

**Resource Management:** Allocation of resources (human and material) with monitoring for availability and capacity.

**Collaboration Tools:** Real-time chat, file sharing, and comment sections for team discussions on tasks and projects.

**Reporting & Analytics:** Ability to generate progress reports, risk assessments, task status, and other analytics to 
provide project insights.

**Notification System:** Alerts and reminders for upcoming deadlines, task updates, and project changes.

**Mobile Compatibility:** A responsive interface for mobile access on iOS and Android platforms.

**Integration with Third-party Tools:** Ability to integrate with popular tools like Slack, Google Calendar, and other cloud
storage services.

## Acceptance Criteria

The project will be considered successful if the following criteria are met:

The application is fully functional with all core features as defined in the scope.

The system is free from critical bugs and vulnerabilities.

The application meets the performance benchmarks for speed and reliability.

User feedback from beta testing is overwhelmingly positive.

All documentation is complete and delivered as per project requirements.

## Project Deliverables (in scope)

Functional prototype of the project management application.

Fully developed and tested web and mobile versions of the application.

User documentation and training materials.

Deployment and implementation of the application.

Ongoing support and maintenance for 6 months post-launch.

## Project Exclusions (out of scope)

The following items are outside the scope of this project:

Development of integrations with internal systems not identified during the planning phase.

Development of non-project-related features (e.g., customer relationship management or accounting tools).

On-site hardware or infrastructure setup for the end-users.

Extensive user training beyond documentation and online tutorials.

## Assumptions

The application will be developed using modern web technologies such as React for the frontend and Node.js for the 
backend.

The target user base will have access to modern browsers and mobile devices.

The project will utilize agile methodologies for iterative development and testing.

User feedback will be incorporated during the testing and feedback phases.

The application will comply with relevant data protection and privacy regulations, including GDPR where applicable.

## Constraints

Limited budget and timeline for development, meaning some features may be prioritized over others in initial versions.

Availability of key stakeholders for feedback and testing phases.

The application must be scalable but will initially focus on small to mid-sized teams.
